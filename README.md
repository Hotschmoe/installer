# Althea Installer

This is the installer for Althea on general purpose Linux. Whereas the [Althea
firmware](https://github.com/althea-mesh/althea-firmware) which is targeted at
OpenWRT compatible routers this installer will work on normal deskop and server
Linux distributions.

Eventually we will publish more traditional packages, in the meantime this
clones and builds the latest release of various Althea components locally. So
to update Althea just run the deployment script again.
